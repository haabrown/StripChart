This is a simple guide to setting up the .ini file located at QB50.ini.
We will first walk through the .ini file contents, and then a demo version
will be provided (in case you break it and want to go back to the default).

About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VMax/VMin - 	Set the maximum and minimum expected voltages from the packet. 
				Note that all read out voltages share the same limit, so the
				max and min should be selected by whichever systems have the
				highest maximum and lowest minimum expected voltages. Note
				also that VMax must be greater then VMin or the program will
				not run properly.

AMax/AMin - 	Set the maximum and minimum expected currents from the packet. 
				Note that all read out currents share the same limit, so the
				max and min should be selected by whichever systems have the
				highest maximum and lowest minimum expected currents. Note
				also that AMax must be greater then AMin or the program will
				not run properly.

TMax/TMin - 	Set the maximum and minimum expected temperatures from the 
				packet. Note that all read out temperatures share the same
				limit, so the max and min should be selected by whichever 
				systems have the highest maximum and lowest minimum expected 
				temperatures. Note also that TMax must be greater then TMin 
				or the program will not run properly.

PacketTime -	The approximate number of seconds between packets. Need not
				be exact.

MaxPackets -	The number of packets to be displayed at one time on the screen. 
				For example, 1000 would mean that no more then 1000 packets
				would be plotted at any one time, with each new packet pushing 
				the oldest packet off the screen.

BaudRate -		Sets the baud rate that the packets are arriving at.

ProvidedPort -	The serial port that the packets will be arriving over.
