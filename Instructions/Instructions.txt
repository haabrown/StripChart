1)	Turn on MATLAB.
2)	Navigate to the directory where you wish to save logfiles and make it the current folder - logfiles will be saved here.
3)	Ensure that QB50.ini has been set to your specifications. (See iniInstructions.txt)
4)	Select strip1.m and run it. Allow 1 second of startup time between program start and first packet transmission.
5)	When you are ready to end the strip chart run, select Stop on the plot button located at the bottom center of the strip chart.
	Do not use control-c or close the window to stop the run, as these methods
	may fail to stop the program or may cause the logfile to develop issues.
6)	The final portion of the strip chart will be left up, additionally the
	raw hex values will be saved in a .bat file, while the physical value
	readings are stored in a .log file.
